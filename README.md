### CatzMe


* This is a project to demonstrate our knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and Javascript. 

*  After a suggestion from one of our former teammates, we decided to do a website for cats. Malik and I decided to name the project Catzme. We offer veterinary services, boarding, and various products. 

* Malik and Darius contributed to the index page.

* Darius was the primary contributor to the Services and Boarding pages, and Malik was the primary contributor on the Products and Contact page.
